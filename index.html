            <p> The Reuben Sandwich is one of the most exquisite grilled sandwiches. It
                contains a beautiful mixture of Swiss cheese and sliced corn beef on
                toasty rye bread. Not only so, but it is also a great food to eat at any
                time throughout the day.</p>
