    <ul>
      <li>4 bacon slices</li>
      <li>1 russet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced oniion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 medium avocado, cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespooons sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cilantro leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a cold, nonstick pan over medium to medium-high heat.
        Cook until browned, crisp, and foamy, about 10 minutes. Turn off the
        heat, remove to a paper towel-lined plate, and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place cubed potatoes into the pan of bacon fat and set heat to medium.
        Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Cook, tossing and turning
        occasionally, until the potatoes are browned, crispy, and tender, 8 to
        10 minutes. Add onions and peppers, and cook until they soften up a bit,
        2 to 3 minutes. Transfer everything into a strainer set over a bowl to
        drain excess bacon fat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To make one breakfast burrito, place 2 strips cooked bacon back in the
        pan. Turn heat to medium and scatter 1/2 of the potato mixture in and
        around. Scatter over 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese as evenly as possible,
        and then pour 2 beaten eggs over top.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Tilt the pan to make sure the egg is evenly distributed. Place a
        tortilla over the top and press down lightly into the rest of the
        ingredients. Cook just until the eggs firm up enough to flip, about 1
        minute. Use a spatula to carefully, but confidently, flip everything
        over so the tortilla is now on the bottom. Cook until the tortilla is as
        browned and crispy as you like, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and transfer onto a plate. Roll into a burrito and
        serve with hot sauce, avocado, sour cream, and cilantro. Repeat to cook
        remaining burrito.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
